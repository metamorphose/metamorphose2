How to use Regular Expressions in Métamorphose.
</b></font>
<br>
<p>
Regular expressions are a powerful way to search for patterns. In this case, the file or
folder name will be searched for whatever pattern you put into the text box.
<br>
Métamorphose uses the Python syntax for regular expressions, which can be a little
different from other forms of regular expressions.
<br>
In the text box, simply put in the expression to match for, do not put in '//'. You can set
extra parameters with the <i><b>I</b></i> (case insensitive) and <i><b>U</b></i> (Unicode)
checkboxes.
</p>

<p>
<font color='blue'><b>
From the Python manual (modified for Métamorphose):
</b></font>

<p>
A brief explanation of the format of regular expressions follows. For further information and a
gentler presentation, consult the Regular Expression HOWTO, accessible from
<a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/">http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/</a>
</p>

<p>
Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters.
Most ordinary characters, like "<b>A</b>", "<b>a</b>", or
"<b>0</b>", are the simplest regular expressions; they simply match
themselves.  You can concatenate ordinary characters, so <b>last</b>

matches the string <code>'last'</code>.  (In the rest of this section, we'll
write RE's in <b>this special style</b>, usually without quotes, and
strings to be matched <code>'in single quotes'</code>.)
</p>

<p>
Some characters, like "<b>|</b>" or "<b>(</b>", are special.
Special characters either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or
affect how the regular expressions around them are interpreted.
</p>

<p>
The special characters are:<br>

<dl>
<dt><b><font color='blue'>.</font></b></dt>
<dd>(Dot)  This matches any character.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>^</font></b></dt>
<dd>(Caret)  Matches the start of the string.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>$</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches the end of the string.  <b>foo</b> matches both 'foo' and
'foobar', while the regular expression <b>foo$</b> matches only
'foo'.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>*</font></b></dt>
<dd>Causes the resulting RE to
match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions
as are possible.  <b>ab*</b> will
match 'a', 'ab', or 'a' followed by any number of 'b's.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>+</font></b></dt>
<dd>Causes the
resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE.
<b>ab+</b> will match 'a' followed by any non-zero number of 'b's; it
will not match just 'a'.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>?</font></b></dt>
<dd>Causes the resulting RE to
match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE.  <b>ab?</b> will
match either 'a' or 'ab'.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>*?</code>, <code>+?</code>, <code>??</font></b></dt>

<dd>The "<b>*</b>",
"<b>+</b>", and "<b>?</b>" qualifiers are all <i>greedy</i>; they
match as much text as possible.  Sometimes this behaviour isn't
desired; if the RE <b>&lt;.*&gt;</b> is matched against
<code>'&lt;H1&gt;title&lt;/H1&gt;'</code>, it will match the entire string,
and not just <code>'&lt;H1&gt;'</code>.  Adding "<b>?</b>" after the qualifier makes it
perform the match in <i>non-greedy</i> or <i>minimal</i> fashion; as
<em>few</em> characters as possible will be matched.  Using <b>.*?</b>
in the previous expression will match only <code>'&lt;H1&gt;'</code>.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>{m}</font></b></dt>
<dd>Specifies that exactly <var>m</var> copies of the previous RE should be
matched; fewer matches cause the entire RE not to match.  For example,
<b>a{6}</b> will match exactly six "<b>a</b>" characters, but
not five.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>{m,n}</font></b></dt>
<dd>Causes the resulting RE to match from
<var>m</var> to <var>n</var> repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to
match as many repetitions as possible.  For example, <b>a{3,5}</b>
will match from 3 to 5 "<b>a</b>" characters.  Omitting <var>m</var>
specifies a lower bound of zero, 
and omitting <var>n</var> specifies an infinite upper bound.  As an
example, <b>a{4,}b</b> will match <code>aaaab</code> or a thousand
"<b>a</b>" characters followed by a <code>b</code>, but not <code>aaab</code>.
The comma may not be omitted or the modifier would be confused with
the previously described form.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>{m,n}?</font></b></dt>
<dd>Causes the resulting RE to
match from <var>m</var> to <var>n</var> repetitions of the preceding RE,
attempting to match as <em>few</em> repetitions as possible.  This is
the non-greedy version of the previous qualifier.  For example, on the
6-character string <code>'aaaaaa'</code>, <b>a{3,5}</b> will match 5
"<b>a</b>" characters, while <b>a{3,5}?</b> will only match 3
characters.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>\</font></b></strong></dt>
<dd>Either escapes special characters (permitting
you to match characters like "<b>*</b>", "<b>?</b>", and so
forth), or signals a special sequence; special sequences are discussed
below.
If you're not using a raw string to
express the pattern, remember that Python also uses the
backslash as an escape sequence in string literals; if the escape
sequence isn't recognized by Python's parser, the backslash and
subsequent character are included in the resulting string.  However,
if Python would recognize the resulting sequence, the backslash should
be repeated twice.  This is complicated and hard to understand, so
it's highly recommended that you use raw strings for all but the
simplest expressions.
<br></dd>
<br>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>[]</font></b></dt>
<dd>Used to indicate a set of characters.  Characters can
be listed individually, or a range of characters can be indicated by
giving two characters and separating them by a "<b>-</b>".  Special
characters are not active inside sets.  For example, <b>[akm$]</b>
will match any of the characters "<b>a</b>", "<b>k</b>",
"<b>m</b>", or "<b>$</b>"; <b>[a-z]</b>
will match any lowercase letter, and <code>[a-zA-Z0-9]</code> matches any
letter or digit.  Character classes such as <code>\w</code> or <code>\S</code>

(defined below) are also acceptable inside a range.  If you want to
include a "<b>]</b>" or a "<b>-</b>" inside a set, precede it with a
backslash, or place it as the first character.  The
pattern <b>[]]</b> will match <code>']'</code>, for example.

You can match the characters not within a range by <i>complementing</i>
the set.  This is indicated by including a
"<b>^</b>" as the first character of the set;
"<b>^</b>" elsewhere will simply match the
"<b>^</b>" character.  For example,

<b>[^5]</b> will match
any character except "<b>5</b>", and
<b>[^<code>^</code>]</b> will match any character
except "<b>^</b>".
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>|</font></b></strong></dt>

<dd><code>A|B</code>, where A and B can be arbitrary REs,
creates a regular expression that will match either A or B.  An
arbitrary number of REs can be separated by the "<b>|</b>" in this
way.  This can be used inside groups (see below) as well.  As the target
string is scanned, REs separated by "<b>|</b>" are tried from left to
right. When one pattern completely matches, that branch is accepted.
This means that once <code>A</code> matches, <code>B</code> will not be tested further,
even if it would produce a longer overall match.  In other words, the
"<b>|</b>" operator is never greedy.  To match a literal "<b>|</b>",
use <b>\|</b>, or enclose it inside a character class, as in <b>[|]</b>.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>(...)</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches whatever regular expression is inside the
parentheses, and indicates the start and end of a group; the contents
of a group can be retrieved after a match has been performed, and can
be matched later in the string with the <b>\<var>number</var></b> special
sequence, described below.  To match the literals "<b>(</b>" or
"<b>)</b>", use <b>\(</b> or <b>\)</b>, or enclose them
inside a character class: <b>[(] [)]</b>.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?...)</font></b></dt>
<dd>This is an extension notation (a "<b>?</b>"
following a "<b>(</b>" is not meaningful otherwise).  The first
character after the "<b>?</b>"
determines what the meaning and further syntax of the construct is.
Extensions usually do not create a new group;
<b>(?P&lt;<var>name</var>&gt;...)</b> is the only exception to this rule.
Following are the currently supported extensions.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?iLmsux)</font></b></dt>
<dd>(One or more letters from the set "<b>i</b>",
"<b>L</b>", "<b>m</b>", "<b>s</b>", "<b>u</b>",
"<b>x</b>".)  The group matches the empty string; the letters set
the corresponding flags (<b>re.I</b>, <b>re.L</b>,

<b>re.M</b>, <b>re.S</b>, <b>re.U</b>, <b>re.X</b>)
for the entire regular expression.  This is useful if you wish to
include the flags as part of the regular expression, instead of
passing a <var>flag</var> argument to the <b>compile()</b> function.

Note that the <b>(?x)</b> flag changes how the expression is parsed.
It should be used first in the expression string, or after one or more
whitespace characters.  If there are non-whitespace characters before
the flag, the results are undefined.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?:...)</font></b></dt>
<dd>A non-grouping version of regular parentheses.
Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, but the
substring matched by the
group <em>cannot</em> be retrieved after performing a match or
referenced later in the pattern.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?P&lt;<var>name</var>&gt;...)</font></b></dt>
<dd>Similar to regular parentheses, but
the substring matched by the group is accessible via the symbolic group
name <var>name</var>.  Group names must be valid Python identifiers, and
each group name must be defined only once within a regular expression.  A
symbolic group is also a numbered group, just as if the group were not
named.  So the group named 'id' in the example above can also be
referenced as the numbered group 1.

For example, if the pattern is
<b>(?P&lt;id&gt;[a-zA-Z_]\w*)</b>, the group can be referenced by its
name in arguments to methods of match objects, such as
<code>m.group('id')</code> or <code>m.end('id')</code>, and also by name in
pattern text (for example, <b>(?P=id)</b>) and replacement text
(such as <code>\g&lt;id&gt;</code>).
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?P=<var>name</var>)</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches whatever text was matched by the
earlier group named <var>name</var>.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?#...)</font></b></dt>
<dd>A comment; the contents of the parentheses are
simply ignored.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?=...)</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches if <b>...</b> matches next, but doesn't
consume any of the string.  This is called a lookahead assertion.  For
example, <b>Isaac (?=Asimov)</b> will match <code>'Isaac&nbsp;'</code> only if it's
followed by <code>'Asimov'</code>.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?!...)</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches if <b>...</b> doesn't match next.  This
is a negative lookahead assertion.  For example,
<b>Isaac (?!Asimov)</b> will match <code>'Isaac&nbsp;'</code> only if it's <em>not</em>
followed by <code>'Asimov'</code>.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?&lt;=...)</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches if the current position in the string
is preceded by a match for <b>...</b> that ends at the current
position.  This is called a <i>positive lookbehind assertion</i>.
<b>(?&lt;=abc)def</b> will find a match in "<b>abcdef</b>", since the
lookbehind will back up 3 characters and check if the contained
pattern matches.  The contained pattern must only match strings of
some fixed length, meaning that <b>abc</b> or <b>a|b</b> are
allowed, but <b>a*</b> and <b>a{3,4}</b> are not.  Note that
patterns which start with positive lookbehind assertions will never
match at the beginning of the string being searched.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?&lt;!...)</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches if the current position in the string
is not preceded by a match for <b>...</b>.  This is called a
<i>negative lookbehind assertion</i>.  Similar to positive lookbehind
assertions, the contained pattern must only match strings of some
fixed length.  Patterns which start with negative lookbehind
assertions may match at the beginning of the string being searched.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>(?(<var>id/name</var>)yes-pattern|no-pattern)</font></b></dt>
<dd>Will try to match
with <b>yes-pattern</b> if the group with given <var>id</var> or <var>name</var>
exists, and with <b>no-pattern</b> if it doesn't. <b>|no-pattern</b>

is optional and can be omitted. For example, 
<b>(&lt;)?(\w+@\w+(?:\.\w+)+)(?(1)&gt;)</b> is a poor email matching
pattern, which will match with <code>'&lt;user@host.com&gt;'</code> as well as
<code>'user@host.com'</code>, but not with <code>'&lt;user@host.com'</code>.
<br></dd>
</dl>

<p>
The special sequences consist of "<b>\</b>" and a character from the
list below.  If the ordinary character is not on the list, then the
resulting RE will match the second character.  For example,
<b>\$</b> matches the character "$".
<dl>
<dt><b><font color='blue'>\number</font></b></dt>

<dd>Matches the contents of the group of the
same number.  Groups are numbered starting from 1.  For example,
<b>(.+) \1</b> matches <code>'the the'</code> or <code>'55 55'</code>, but not
<code>'the end'</code> (note
the space after the group).  This special sequence can only be used to
match one of the first 99 groups.  If the first digit of <var>number</var>
is 0, or <var>number</var> is 3 octal digits long, it will not be interpreted
as a group match, but as the character with octal value <var>number</var>.
Inside the "<b>[</b>" and "<b>]</b>" of a character class, all numeric
escapes are treated as characters.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>\A</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches only at the start of the string.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>\b</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches the empty string, but only at the
beginning or end of a word.  A word is defined as a sequence of
alphanumeric or underscore characters, so the end of a word is indicated by
whitespace or a non-alphanumeric, non-underscore character.  Note that 
<code>\b</code> is defined as the boundary between <code>\w</code> and <code>\
W</code>, so the precise set of characters deemed to be alphanumeric depends on the
values of the <code>UNICODE</code> and <code>LOCALE</code> flags.  Inside a character
range, <b>\b</b> represents the backspace character, for compatibility
with Python's string literals.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>\B</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches the empty string, but only when it is <em>not</em>
at the beginning or end of a word.  This is just the opposite of <code>\
b</code>, so is also subject to the settings of <code>LOCALE</code> and <code>UNICODE</code>.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>\d</font></b></dt>
<dd>When the UNICODE flag is not specified, matches
any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the set <b>[0-9]</b>. 
With UNICODE, it will match whatever is classified as a digit
in the Unicode character properties database.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>\D</font></b></dt>
<dd>When the UNICODE flag is not specified, matches
any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the set 

<b>[^0-9]</b>.  With UNICODE, it will match 
anything other than character marked as digits in the Unicode character 
properties database.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>\s</font></b></dt>
<dd>When the UNICODE flag is not specified, matches any whitespace
character; this is equivalent to the set <b>[ \t\n\r\f\v]</b>.
If UNICODE is set, this will match the characters <b>[ \t\n\r\f\v]</b> plus
whatever is classified as space in the Unicode character properties
database.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>\S</font></b></dt>
<dd>When the UNICODE flag is not specified, matches any
non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the set <b>[^ \t\n\r\f\v]</b>
If UNICODE is set, this will match anything other than <b>[ \t\n\r\f\v]</b>
and characters marked as space in the Unicode character properties database.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>\w</font></b></dt>
<dd>When the UNICODE
flag is not specified, matches any alphanumeric character and the
underscore; this is equivalent to the set
<b>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</b>.  If UNICODE is set, this will match the
characters <b>[0-9_]</b> plus whatever is classified as alphanumeric
in the Unicode character properties database.
<br></dd>

<dt><b><font color='blue'>\W</font></b></dt>
<dd>When the UNICODE flags are not specified, matches any
non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the set <b>[^a-zA-Z0-9_]</b>.
If UNICODE is set, this will match anything other than
<b>[0-9_]</b> and characters marked as alphanumeric in the Unicode
character properties database.
<br></dd>


<dt><b><font color='blue'>\Z</font></b></dt>
<dd>Matches only at the end of the string.
<br></dd>
</dl>


<p>
Most of the standard escapes supported by Python string literals are
also accepted by the regular expression parser:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
\a      \b      \f      \n
\r      \t      \v      \x
\\
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Octal escapes are included in a limited form: If the first digit is a
0, or if there are three octal digits, it is considered an octal
escape. Otherwise, it is a group reference.  As for string literals,
octal escapes are always at most three digits in length.
