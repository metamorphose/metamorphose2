<a name='style'><P></a>
<IMG src="images/style_box.png"><BR>
All options contained within this box affect numbering regardless of how the sequence counts.
</P>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG src="images/numerical_pad.png"><BR>
This is the default style of numbering sequence, using regular numbers. By default the
<I>Pad</I> is checked for proper sorting of filenames. You can use any valid character
for the padding.
</P>
<P>
<IMG src="images/numerical_pad_size.png"><BR>
Here you can set more padding options for <I>Numerical</I> numbering. By default,
<I>Autopad</I> is used to make all numbering the same length regardless of how
many items are being renamed. However if you need a <I>Fixed pad width</I>, you can
also specify that.
</P>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG src="images/alphabetical.png"><BR>
Use this option if you want to renumber alphabeticaly. By default, <I>auto pad</I> is
enabled, this makes all numbering have the same length for correct sorting. You may use
either lowercase or uppercase letters.
</P>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG src="images/roman_numeral.png"><BR>
Use this option if you want to renumber by roman numeral. Note that all numbers
must be between 1 and 4999, due to a limitation of this number system. If there are
numbers with greater or lesser value an error will occur.<BR>
Normally roman numerals are uppercase, however you can uncheck the checkbox if you
want lowercase.
</P>
<BR>

<a name='sort'><P></a>
<IMG src="images/order_box.png"><BR>
Use these options to adjust the ordering of items when numbering.
</P>
<BR>
<p>
<img src="images/sort.png" border='0'><BR>
This allows you to change the order in which items will be numbered. <I>Ascending</I> numbers
items in the normal way: 1,2,3,4, <I>Descending</I> is reversed numbering: 4,3,2,1, and
<I>Manually</I> numbers items in the <B>order in which they are selected</B> in the
<I>selection area</I>, and allows you to change item order manually.<BR>
Note that if you use the <I>all</I> button to select items with the
<I>No Sorting</I> option, items will be sorted in ascending order.
</p><BR>
<P>
<IMG src="images/manual_sort.png"><BR>
If <i>sort all items</i> is set to <i>Manually</i>, then you can click on an item in the preview list
to select it, then move the item within the list using the buttons.<br>
From left to right: move up by 1, move down by 1, move up by 5, move down by 5, move to top of list, move to bottom.
</P>
<BR>

<HR width="50%">

<a name='count'><P></a>
<IMG src="images/counting_box.png"><BR>
All options contained within this box affect numbering regardless of style being used.<BR>
These options modify how to the numbering sequence counts.
</P>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG src="images/count_start.png"><BR>
This is the starting value for the numbering. Number will be converted to its
alphabetical or roman numeral equivalent, if either of those are being used.
<br>
If <i>Start at number of items</i> is checked, then the starting value is calculated
automatically from the total number of items you are renaming.
</P>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG src="images/count_direction.png"><BR>
Specify which way to count. You can go as negative as you want, however,
this will cause errors if using alphabetical or roman numerals.
</P>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG src="images/count_by.png"><BR>
Specify the count increment. If <i>Count by directory</i> is checked, then
the count is only changed when the directory changes.
</P>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG src="images/count_reset.png"><BR>
Specify if you want the count to reset after a certain number of items, this is regardless
of the value. '0' means 'do not reset'. Can be used in conjunction with <I>reset count
every directory</I>.<br>
When used in conjunction with the 'walk' option in picker, <I>reset count
every directory</I> will reset numbering every time the directory changes. Great for renumbering
whole mp3 albums several albums at a time!
